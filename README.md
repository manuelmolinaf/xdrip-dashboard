# Xdrip Dashboard

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.4.

I'm making a costum dashboard with the Xdrip API!

Xdrip is an open-source software application that can be used with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems. It provides a way to view and track real-time blood glucose levels and trends on a mobile device, such as a smartphone or smartwatch.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
